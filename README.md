# Panteon Case Project

![gameplay](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5f35288-709e-453d-8e5f-2d701690bed1)

This is a case project developed for **Panteon Games** as part of the recruitment process.  
It demonstrates a modular, scalable architecture for a tile-based strategy/management game built in **Unity** using **best practices** such as:

- **MVC UI architecture**
- **ScriptableObject-driven data**
- **Grid-based building placement**
- **Selectable soldiers with pathfinding AI**
- **Dynamic UI and object pooling**
- **Modular combat and unit production system**

---

## Project Features

- Grid-based building placement with preview and validation  
- Production system
- Selectable units/buildings with dynamic info panel
- Custom A\* pathfinding system tailored for a tile-based environment
- Attack mechanics via `IAttacker` and `IDamageable` interfaces  
- Object pooling for performance-friendly UI and runtime elements  
- Clean MVC separation for UI elements  
- Easily expandable and editor-friendly design
